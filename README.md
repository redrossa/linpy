# Matstep (linpy)

Matstep (linpy) is an extensible step-by-step symbolic computation library. This project is currently under construction. There are two packages: `matstep` and `linpy`. The `matstep` package is the main package, where it will contain the distribution of this library. The `linpy` contains some matrix computation methods, but will no longer be updated and will be removed in the future. This repository will change its name to matstep.
